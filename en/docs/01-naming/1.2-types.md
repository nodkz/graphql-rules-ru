### <a name="rule-1.2"></a> 1.2. Use `UpperCamelCase` for naming GraphQL types.

Naming types differs from naming fields.

```diff
- type blogPost { # BAD
- type Blog_Post { # so-so
+ type BlogPost { # GOOD
    title: String!
  }
```

GraphQL comes with several scalar types out of the box: `String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `Float`. They are named using `UpperCamelCase`.

Internal GraphQL types-inrospections `__Type`, `__Field`, `__InputValue` etc. are named through `UpperCamelCase` with two underlines at start.

GraphQL is a static type request language. There a lot of projects which generate type definitions for static analysis from GraphQL-requests. If we look at a common approach for complex types naming in Flowtype and TypeScript we see that it mainly uses `UpperCamelCase`.

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)), we should use `UpperCamelCase` in JavaScript, Java, Swift и Kotlin for classes and types declarations.
